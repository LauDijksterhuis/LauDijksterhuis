## A few of my skills

Learning every coding language in the world is an impossible task. So instead, I decided to focus on a few platforms that help me build beautiful and reliable apps and websites.
<details>
<summary>Flutter</summary>
<hr>
After I finished my first course about Android app development on <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803 ">Udacity</a>, I came across Flutter and I loved it immediately. The unlimited styling possibilities and the ability to write code once and deploy it to multiple platforms jumpstarted my career as an app developer. 
<br><br>
Today I have built multiple Flutter apps that run on all kind of platforms from Smart TV's to Phones and even within Microsoft Teams.

<summary>WordPress</summary>
<hr>
    The very first website I build in my life was power by WordPress. <b>I hated it...</b> one plugin broke the whole website and I decided to learn how to code myself.
<br><br>
    After a few years I decided to give WordPress another try (because of my job) and I loved it. Working with reliable plugins like <a href="https://jetpack.com" target="_blank">Jetpack</a> makes building with WordPress fast and fun while being sure there is a backup no matter what happens.

<summary>Angular</summary>
<hr>
    At the moment I am still kind off new to JavaScript frameworks but so far Angular has been great to use.

<details>
<summary>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</summary>
<hr>
My story started the same as many developers
    <ul> <li>It all started with a simple webpage that said **Hello world!**. 
    
<li>Next, the font was italic and red, <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;"> Hello world! </span>.</li>

<li>And finally, the console said <span style="font-family: 'Courier New'">Hello world from JavaScript</span> 
</li></ul>
I still like to begin with that blank sheet and create custom HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create beautiful unique UI's that extend my WordPress & Angular sites.

Learning and thinking about code made me realize how wonderful open-source projects are and the ability to buildup on each other's resources. This optimistic ideology is something we can and should all contribute to.
