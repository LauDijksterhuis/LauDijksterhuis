# Hi there üëãüèº
My name is **[Lau Dijksterhuis](https://laudijksterhuis.com "Laudijksterhuis.com")**. I am a digital enthusiast with a passion for creating a unified brand experience throughout digital media and platforms.

## A few of my skills

Learning every coding language in the world is an impossible task. So instead, I decided to focus on a few platforms that help me build beautiful and reliable apps and websites.
<details>
<summary>Flutter</summary>
<hr>
After I finished my first course about Android app development on <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803 ">Udacity</a>, I came across Flutter and I loved it immediately. The unlimited styling possibilities and the ability to write code once and deploy it to multiple platforms jumpstarted my career as an app developer. 
<br><br>
Today I have built multiple Flutter apps that run on all kind of platforms from Smart TV's to Phones and even within Microsoft Teams.

<summary>WordPress</summary>
<hr>
    The very first website I build in my life was power by WordPress. <b>I hated it...</b> one plugin broke the whole website and I decided to learn how to code myself.
<br><br>
    After a few years I decided to give WordPress another try (because of my job) and I loved it. Working with reliable plugins like <a href="https://jetpack.com" target="_blank">Jetpack</a> makes building with WordPress fast and fun while being sure there is a backup no matter what happens.

<summary>Angular</summary>
<hr>
    At the moment I am still kind off new to JavaScript frameworks but so far Angular has been great to use.

<details>
<summary>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</summary>
<hr>
My story started the same as many developers
    <ul> <li>It all started with a simple webpage that said **Hello world!**. 
    
<li>Next, the font was italic and red, <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;"> Hello world! </span>.</li>

<li>And finally, the console said <span style="font-family: 'Courier New'">Hello world from JavaScript</span> 
</li></ul>
I still like to begin with that blank sheet and create custom HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create beautiful unique UI's that extend my WordPress & Angular sites.

## My contributions to open source
Learning and thinking about code made me realize how wonderful open-source projects are and the ability to buildup on each other's resources. This optimistic ideology is something we can and should all contribute to. But sadly, it is not all sunshine and rainbows...

Each has their own way to contribute, one writes code and makes it publicly available, the other reads and check code for security issues and vulnerabilities.
<br><br>
This is important because open-source code also has a dark side. For example: Hackers that infiltrate big open-source projects, which many computers, servers or companies rely on, can spread some kind of malware to millions if not billions of computers. Which threatens all kinds of data, companies and in the worst case real people and societies. 
<br><br>
Personally, as a young developer, I feel responsible for contributing to de bright side of open-source software. That is why started publishing solutions to problems I have faced myself (mostly with Flutter). 
<br><br>
These can be small things like how to round the corners off a <span style="background-color: #aaa; color: #222; padding: 2px 8px; border-radius: 4px; word-spacing: 16px;">ExpansionTile ‚ñæ</span>. But also, bigger things like a fully customizable  World Map including every country & Island in the world (as far as I could find). Which you can both find at <a href="https://github.com/simplewidgets"> https://github.com/simplewidgets </a>
<br><br>
As a final note, I would like to encourage every developer to contribute to opensource code and check it for vulnerabilities (including mine) so together we can build a safe and open future.
